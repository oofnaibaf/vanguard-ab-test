# vanguard-ab-test

## Overview

Vanguard is a leading American investment firm, managing 9.3 btrillion in global assets and Vanguard is commited to investor-centric principles and cost-effective investment solutions. Therefore, this project focuses on analyzing the results of a digital experiment conducted by Vanguard, to assess whether a redesigned user interface (UI) leads to higher completion rates of an online process.

The experiment consists of two groups of clients: a Control group using the old UI and a Test group using the new UI. The objective is to evaluate the performance of both groups and assess whether the new design enhances completion rates.

## Key Objectives

The project aims to assess whether the new UI improves completion rates compared to the old UI, while also evaluating its cost-effectiveness and potential demographic differences in adoption and success. This will involve Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), hypothesis testing, performance evaluation, and data visualization using Python and Tableau.

## Datasets

The analysis relies on three key datasets:

Client Profiles (df_final_demo): Demographics such as age, gender, account details of Vanguard clients.
Digital Footprints (df_final_web_data): A detailed trace of client interactions online, divided into two parts: pt_1 and pt_2.
Experiment Roster (df_final_experiment_clients): A list revealing which clients participated in the experiment.
